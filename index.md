## SPACE X FALCON 9 LANDING PREDICTION
I predicted if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX
advetises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of
62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million
dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the
first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will
land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This informa􀀨on can
be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a
rocket launch.
